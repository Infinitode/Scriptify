## Usage

Use your microphone to transcribe your speech into text. Scriptify will automatically transcribe all heard speech text. After transcription, you can manually edit and proofread, or start again.

## Minimum Requirements

Scriptify's minimum requirements will change based on the used Whipser model upon launch.

- Upon launch, Scriptify will ask for you to select a Whisper model to run, these models are saved to the `/models/` directory, for later use.

- Scriptify will then download your chosen model (it may take a while depending on your internet speed), and load it. If you have previously used a model, Scriptify will load it from your file system instead of re-downloading it.

> [!TIP]
> Larger models require more VRAM and computational power to run. If you're not sure which model to pick, we recommend starting with the smallest model and later moving to larger models.
